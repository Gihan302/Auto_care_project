</ul>
<h3 id="scope">1.3. Scope</h3>
<p>The scope of this project report is to provide a comprehensive
overview of the Auto Care web application, with a specific focus on the
implementation of the agent role and the user management system. The
report will cover the following aspects:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>System Architecture:</strong> An overview of the frontend,
backend, and database technologies used in the project.</li>
<li><strong>User Management System:</strong> A detailed description of
the user roles, authentication and authorization mechanisms, and the
user management dashboard.</li>
<li><strong>Agent Role Implementation:</strong> A breakdown of the
functionalities available to agents, including advertisement management,
package management, and application handling.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="system-architecture">2. System Architecture</h2>
<h3 id="frontend-next.js">2.1. Frontend (Next.js)</h3>
<p>The frontend of the Auto Care application is built using Next.js, a
popular React framework that enables server-side rendering and static
site generation. This choice of technology provides several advantages,
including improved performance, SEO-friendliness, and a better user
experience.</p>
<p>The frontend architecture is organized into the following key
areas:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Routing:</strong> The application uses the Next.js App
Router, which is a new routing system that supports shared layouts,
nested routing, and loading states. The application’s routes are
organized into role-based groups (e.g., <code>(admin)</code>,
<code>(agent)</code>, <code>(user)</code>), which allows for clear
separation of concerns and easier implementation of role-based access
control.</li>
<li><strong>UI Components:</strong> The UI is built using a combination
of custom components and components from the <code>lucide-react</code>
and <code>react-icons</code> libraries. The application also uses
<code>tailwindcss</code> for styling, which provides a highly
customizable and utility-first CSS framework.</li>
<li><strong>State Management:</strong> The application uses a
combination of React’s built-in state management (e.g.,
<code>useState</code>, <code>useContext</code>) and custom hooks (e.g.,
<code>useLocalStorage</code>) to manage the application’s state.</li>
<li><strong>API Communication:</strong> All communication with the
backend API is handled through a centralized <code>axios</code>
instance. This instance is configured with an interceptor that
automatically attaches the authentication token to every outgoing
request, simplifying the logic in other components.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="backend-spring-boot">2.2. Backend (Spring Boot)</h3>
<p>The backend of the Auto Care application is a robust and scalable
RESTful API built using the Spring Boot framework. Spring Boot
simplifies the development of stand-alone, production-grade Spring-based
applications.</p>
<p>The backend architecture is structured as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Controllers:</strong> The <code>controllers</code> package
contains the REST controllers that handle incoming HTTP requests. Each
controller is responsible for a specific domain (e.g.,
<code>AdController</code>, <code>UserController</code>,
<code>AgentController</code>).</li>
<li><strong>Models:</strong> The <code>models</code> package defines the
data models (entities) that represent the application’s data structure.
These models are mapped to the database tables.</li>
<li><strong>Repositories:</strong> The <code>repository</code> package
contains the Spring Data JPA repositories that provide an abstraction
layer for data access. These repositories offer methods for performing
CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on the database.</li>
<li><strong>Services:</strong> The <code>service</code> package contains
the business logic of the application. The services are responsible for
orchestrating the data flow between the controllers and the
repositories.</li>
<li><strong>Security:</strong> The application uses Spring Security for
authentication and authorization. It implements a JWT (JSON Web Token)
based authentication system, where each user is issued a token upon
successful login. This token is then used to authenticate subsequent
requests.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="database">2.3. Database</h3>
<p>The application uses a MySQL database to store and manage its data.
The database is configured in the <code>application.properties</code>
file, which contains the database URL, username, and password. Spring
Data JPA is used to map the application’s data models to the database
tables, and the repositories provide a high-level API for interacting
with the database.</p>
<h2 id="user-management-system">3. User Management System</h2>
<h3 id="user-roles-admin-agent-user">3.1. User Roles (Admin, Agent,
User)</h3>
<p>The Auto Care application has a role-based access control system that
defines the permissions and functionalities available to different types
of users. The three primary user roles are:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Admin:</strong> The administrator has the highest level of
access and is responsible for managing the entire system. This includes
managing users, advertisements, packages, and other system-level
configurations.</li>
<li><strong>Agent:</strong> The agent is a registered user who can
create and manage advertisements for vehicles. Agents have access to a
dedicated dashboard where they can manage their listings, view
applications, and interact with potential buyers.</li>
<li><strong>User:</strong> The user is a regular user who can browse and
search for vehicles, view advertisements, and apply for leasing or
insurance plans.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="authentication-and-authorization-jwt">3.2. Authentication and
Authorization (JWT)</h3>
<p>The Auto Care application uses JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for
authentication and authorization. This is a standard and secure method
for authenticating users and ensuring that they only have access to the
resources they are authorized to view.</p>
<p>The authentication process is as follows:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Login:</strong> When a user logs in with their credentials,
the frontend sends a request to the backend’s
<code>/api/auth/signin</code> endpoint.</li>
<li><strong>Token Generation:</strong> If the credentials are valid, the
backend generates a JWT token that contains the user’s ID, username, and
roles. This token is then sent back to the frontend.</li>
<li><strong>Token Storage:</strong> The frontend stores the JWT token in
the browser’s local storage.</li>
<li><strong>Authenticated Requests:</strong> For every subsequent
request to the backend, the frontend attaches the JWT token to the
request’s <code>Authorization</code> header.</li>
<li><strong>Token Validation:</strong> The backend uses a custom
<code>AuthTokenFilter</code> to validate the JWT token on every request.
If the token is valid, the user’s authentication is set in the Spring
Security context, and the request is allowed to proceed.</li>
<li><strong>Role-Based Authorization:</strong> The backend uses
method-level security annotations (e.g., <code>@PreAuthorize</code>) to
restrict access to certain endpoints based on the user’s roles.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="user-registration">3.3. User Registration</h3>
<p>New users can register for an account through the
<code>SignUpForm.jsx</code> component. This form collects the user’s
username, email, and password. Upon submission, the form sends a POST
request to the <code>/api/auth/signup</code> endpoint. The backend then
creates a new user with the “User” role and an initial status of
“Pending”. The user’s account will need to be approved by an
administrator before they can log in.</p>
<h3 id="admin-user-management-dashboard">3.4. Admin User Management
Dashboard</h3>
<p>The administrator has access to a comprehensive user management
dashboard, which is implemented in the
<code>src/app/(admin)/admin/manageUsers/page.jsx</code> component. This
dashboard provides the administrator with the following
functionalities:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>View Users:</strong> The administrator can view a list of
all registered users, along with their roles and status.</li>
<li><strong>Search and Filter:</strong> The administrator can search for
specific users and filter the user list based on their roles and
status.</li>
<li><strong>Edit Users:</strong> The administrator can edit the details
of a user, including their username, email, and roles.</li>
<li><strong>Approve/Reject Users:</strong> The administrator can approve
or reject new user registrations.</li>
<li><strong>Delete Users:</strong> The administrator can delete user
accounts from the system.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="agent-role-implementation">4. Agent Role Implementation</h2>
<h3 id="agent-dashboard">4.1. Agent Dashboard</h3>
<p>The agent dashboard is the central hub for agents to manage their
activities on the Auto Care platform. It is implemented in the
<code>src/app/(agent)/agent/dashboard/page.jsx</code> component and
provides the following key features:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Overview:</strong> The dashboard provides a summary of the
agent’s key metrics, such as the number of active ads, sold ads, and
total applications.</li>
<li><strong>Recent Activity:</strong> A feed of recent activities, such
as new applications and messages.</li>
<li><strong>Navigation:</strong> A sidebar with links to other
agent-specific pages, such as “My Ads”, “Create Ad”, and
“Applications”.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="advertisement-management">4.2. Advertisement Management</h3>
<p>Agents have the ability to create, manage, and view their
advertisements.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Create Advertisement:</strong> Agents can create new
advertisements by providing details about the vehicle, such as the make,
model, year, price, and images. This is handled by the
<code>src/app/(agent)/agent/create-ad/page.jsx</code> component.</li>
<li><strong>My Advertisements:</strong> Agents can view a list of all
the advertisements they have created in the
<code>src/app/(agent)/agent/my-ads/page.jsx</code> component.</li>
<li><strong>Edit Advertisement:</strong> Agents can edit their existing
advertisements through the
<code>src/app/(agent)/agent/edit-ad/[adId]/page.jsx</code>
component.</li>
<li><strong>Sold Advertisements:</strong> Agents can view a list of
their sold advertisements in the
<code>src/app/(agent)/agent/sold-ads/page.jsx</code> component.</li>
<li><strong>All Advertisements:</strong> Agents can also view all
advertisements on the platform from the
<code>src/app/(agent)/agent/all-ads/page.jsx</code> component.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="package-management">4.3. Package Management</h3>
<p>Agents can purchase packages to enhance their advertisement
visibility and reach. The package management system includes the
following features:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>View Packages:</strong> Agents can view the available
packages in the <code>src/app/(agent)/agent/plans/page.jsx</code>
component.</li>
<li><strong>Buy Packages:</strong> Agents can purchase packages through
the <code>src/app/(agent)/agent/buy-packages/page.jsx</code>
component.</li>
<li><strong>Package Usage:</strong> Agents can monitor their package
usage and remaining benefits in the
<code>src/app/(agent)/agent/package-usage/page.jsx</code>
component.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="application-handling">4.4. Application Handling</h3>
<p>Agents can view and manage the applications submitted by users for
their vehicle advertisements. This is handled by the
<code>src/app/(agent)/agent/applications/page.jsx</code> component,
which provides the following functionalities:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>View Applications:</strong> Agents can view a list of all
applications for their advertisements.</li>
<li><strong>Application Details:</strong> Agents can view the details of
each application, including the applicant’s information and
